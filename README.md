# node-exmple

This was done in a [Cloud9](https://c9.io/login) Node workspace

To set up the environment
    
    $npm install
    
    $npm install mysql
    
    $npm install body-parser
    
I set a free mysql database in [Gearhost](http://gearhost.com) and the project links to it.

Use Workbench, set up a new connection with the details from Gearhost and view database locally.
